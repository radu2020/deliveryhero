# How to install and configure AWS CLI

### 1. **Signing up for an AWS account**

- Go to [https://aws.amazon.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- Click **"Create an AWS Account"** (top right).
- Fill in your email, password, and account name.
- Choose **Personal** or **Business** account type.
- Add your billing information (credit card needed, but they have a free tier).
- Verify your identity (phone number verification).
- Choose a support plan (you can pick the **Free** one).
- Finish account creation (it might take a few minutes to activate).

### 2. **Creating an Administrative IAM User**

Once you're signed in to the AWS Management Console:

- Go to the **IAM** service (search "IAM" in the search bar).
- Click **Users** > **Add users**.
- Set a username (like `admin-user`) and **select "Provide user access to the AWS Management Console"**.
- Choose **"Password - Autogenerated or custom"** (your choice) and **Require password reset** if you want.
- **Permissions**:
  - Choose **Attach policies directly**.
  - Search for **AdministratorAccess**, and attach it.
- Review and **Create user**.

### 3. **Creating an Access Key ID and Secret Access Key**

For that user:

- In the **IAM dashboard**, find the new user you just created.
- Click on the username > **Security Credentials** tab.
- Scroll to **Access keys** > click **Create access key**.
- Choose **Command Line Interface (CLI)** use case.
- Click **Next**, then **Create access key**.
- **IMPORTANT**: Download the `.csv` file or copy the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** — you **won't see the secret again**!

### 4. **Installing the AWS CLI**

Depending on your system:

- **Windows**: Download the installer [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).
- **Mac/Linux**: Use Homebrew or package managers:
  ```bash
  brew install awscli
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  sudo apt install awscli
  ```
- Verify it's installed:
  ```bash
  aws --version
  ```

---

### 5. **Configuring AWS credentials**

Now set up your local AWS CLI to use your credentials:

```bash
aws configure
```

It will prompt you:

- **AWS Access Key ID** → paste it
- **AWS Secret Access Key** → paste it
- **Default region name** (example: `us-east-1`, or choose another close to you)
- **Default output format** (you can just press Enter for `json`)

> Done! The machine is now connected to your AWS account using the CLI!
